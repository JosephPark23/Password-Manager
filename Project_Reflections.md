# **Project Reflections & Updates**

### **11/3/2024**
- I'm starting this project reflections and updates file so I can better organize my ideas and tasks
  for this project. I've been working on this project for a few days already and I have a specific
  structure in mind.
#### - TODO:
    - Continue working on the hash storage and comparison functions: Need to keep updating the hash
    - Finish the rest of the architecture: the homepage interface, decision trees, and getting the passwords
    - Add exception handlers to the file opening blocks and password confirmation procedures for the vault setup file

### **11/5/2024**
- I've developed the structure more in the past few days. My plan is to create the bare, terminal-based
  manager first, then transition to a more advanced, GUI-based, feature-rich application
- I've created the authentication file but I still have work to do: I have to integrate the hash and salt
  filepath storage mechanisms into both the authentication and vault creation files, and add exception
  mechanisms to ensure smooth running
- I also have to manage the print statements and user interactions in the files themselves
##### - Some ideas I have for the future:
  - Integrate Tkinter or a GUI library to make the application more robust and accessible
  - Add a 2FA feature during authentication or such to ensure the ID of the user

### **11/12/2024**
- Today, I finished integrating the hash and salt storage files/algorithms and I now have to work on
  finishing the vault modification and view files. After I'm done with that, I should be able to move on
  to creating more advanced features, such as TKinter, 2FA, and other cool applications. I also have to add
  exception mechanisms into the code to make it more robust. 
#### - TODO:
    - Finish creating vault modification and access files
    - Add exception mechanisms to ensure robustness
    - Brainstorm more ideas for better features and security

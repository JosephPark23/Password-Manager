**Project Reflections & Updates**

**11/3/2024**
- I'm starting this project reflections and updates file so I can better organize my ideas and tasks
  for this project. I've been working on this project for a few days already and I have a specific
  structure in mind.
- TODO:
    - Continue working on the hash storage and comparison functions: Need to keep updating the hash
    - Finish the rest of the architecture: the homepage interface, decision trees, and getting the passwords
    - Add exception handlers to the file opening blocks and password confirmation procedures for the vault setup file
